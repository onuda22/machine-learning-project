    "Description: This script uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various factors. World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This whole research inteds to pinpoint the ratio of patients who possess a good chance of being affected by CVD and also to predict the overall risk using Logistic Regression"
